Whackamole Game
=================

Play the demo on Glitch: https://whacka-smol-mol.glitch.me/

Another simple retro game clone based off of a tutorial by [Ania Kubow](https://github.com/kubowania/whack-a-mole). 
I added some additional functionality to play the game multiple times and to save a high score.

Future Work
------------
- spawn multiple moles at once
- create custom 8-bit sprite (one that's not mirroring the mole sprite from the [Monty Mole game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanted:_Monty_Mole) on the ZX Spectrum). 
- animations?
